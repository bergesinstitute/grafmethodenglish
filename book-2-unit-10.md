# My trip to Chicago

Last week, I went to Chicago, and I liked it a lot. 

I arrived on Monday at 8 pm. I took the train (tren/metro) to my hotel, and went to bed.

On Tuesday, I got up very early - at 7 am. I walked near (cerca) the river until (hasta) 9 am, and then I did an architecture tour. 
The architecture in Chicago is beautiful. There are many old skyscrapers (rascacielos) from the 1920s.

After the tour, I wanted to see the Art Institute of Chicago, but I couldn't get in because I
didn't have tickets, and I couldn't buy them at the door.

I went to Millennium Park, and then I ate Chicago pizza in a famous restaurant.

On Wednesday I didn't do much. I got up late (tarde). I walked around the city, I went to a restaurant for lunch,
and then I went to a Blues show in the evening. The guitar player was excellent.

On Thursday, I took a taxi to the airport, and I flew back to Barcelona.

I am in my apartment in Gr√†cia, now, writing this. I love Barcelona, but, after this trip, Chicago is my favorite city!
